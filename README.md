# amazon_dentiment_analysis

In this project i analysed amazon review dataset , This dataset contains several million reviews of Amazon products, with the reviews separated into two classes for positive and negative reviews. The two classes are evenly balanced here.

# Problem statement:
Which machine learning approach performs better in terms of accuracy on the Amazon products reviews and can we increase it upto as high as 95%?

With the increase in products in the e-commerce market there is a great need of the sorting and arranging the products which are the best and which are liked by the people Analyzing this enormous amount of opinions is also hard and time consuming for product manufacturers.  This project considers the problem of classifying reviews by classifying whether it is positive or negative.

# Approach
 I will do some very simple text processing and then try out two fairly unoptimized deep learning models:
1. A convolutional neural net.
2. A recurrent neural net These models should achieve results that are within a couple percent of state of the art at predicting the binary sentiment of the reviews. For the data set i will use the basic review dataset from kaggle.
These models should achieve results that are within a couple percent of state of the art at predicting the binary sentiment of the reviews.
