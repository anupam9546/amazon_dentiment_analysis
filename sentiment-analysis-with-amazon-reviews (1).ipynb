    "With the increase in products in the e-commerce market there is a great need of the sorting and arranging the products which are the best and which are liked by the people Analyzing this enormous amount of opinions is also hard and time consuming for product manufacturers.  This project considers the problem of classifying reviews by classifying whether it is positive or negative.\n",
